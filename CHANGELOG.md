# Changelog

## 2.5.2 - 2026-10-01

### Fixed
- Ignore disabled or stale Entity Registry entries when generating dashboards, preventing optional cards from being generated for entities that Home Assistant reports as `Entiteit niet gevonden`.
- Keep temporarily unavailable entities eligible for dashboards when they still have a valid Home Assistant State object.

### Improved
- Cache shared serialized price arrays once per coordinator analysis cycle instead of rebuilding them independently for every EnerPrice sensor, reducing repeated work during state updates.
- Target the slow `today_score` state-update warning observed during real Home Assistant validation without removing existing price attributes or dashboard compatibility.

### Compatibility
- Existing EnerPrice entities, services, integration domain and v2.5.1 configuration remain compatible.
- EnerPrice remains advisory and does not automatically switch connected devices.

## 2.5.1 - 2026-10-01

### Fixed
- Refresh Smart Energy Advisor state safely on the Home Assistant event loop when configured P1/grid, solar or gas entities change, avoiding thread-safety warnings and stale live measurements.
- Preserve Smart Setup entity selections, efficiencies, flexible-device settings and advice language when Smart Setup is disabled and later re-enabled.
- Treat tiny measured grid export below the configured solar-surplus threshold as insignificant instead of reporting a misleading partial surplus.
- Generate Smart Energy dashboards without guessed optional Entity Registry IDs, preventing `Entiteit niet gevonden` cards when optional entities are unavailable or disabled.
- Hide missing advisor copy instead of rendering a literal `None` value.

### Improved
- Rename flexible-load wording to the clearer `flexibel apparaat` / `flexible device` terminology.
- Add field-level Smart Setup guidance for P1 sign convention, units, gas-price input, efficiencies, solar measurements and flexible-device power.
- Clarify that a separate solar-production sensor is optional when usable P1/grid measurements are available and that multiple inverter sensors can be combined with a Home Assistant template sensor.
- Expand regression coverage for Smart Setup lifecycle behavior, dashboard generation and meaningful solar-surplus thresholds.

### Compatibility
- Existing EnerPrice entities, services, integration domain and v2.5.0 configuration remain compatible.
- EnerPrice remains advisory and does not automatically switch connected devices.


## 2.5.0 - 2026-10-01

### Added
- Add optional Smart Setup for storing grid/P1 power, solar production, gas price, one flexible load, efficiencies, gas energy content, surplus threshold and advice language.
- Add a persistent Smart Energy Advisor sensor that combines live Home Assistant inputs with EnerPrice all-in prices and refreshes when configured grid, solar or gas entities change.
- Add an adaptive Smart Energy dashboard generator that resolves actual Entity Registry IDs and includes only the Smart Setup inputs that are configured.
- Add Dutch and English Smart Energy dashboard labels, current advice, useful-heat costs and next-better-price timing.
- Add practical Home Assistant release-validation documentation for Smart Setup, hourly/quarter-hour prices and generated dashboards.

### Improved
- Reuse stored Smart Setup defaults in the Smart Energy Advisor service while keeping explicit service-call values authoritative.
- Reload the config entry when Smart Setup is enabled/disabled or its live input entity IDs change, preventing missing advisor entities and stale state listeners.
- Preserve missing or unavailable live measurements as unknown instead of silently treating them as zero.
- Expand regression coverage for the Smart Energy dashboard contract, zero-versus-unknown measurements and Smart Setup lifecycle changes.

### Compatibility
- Smart Setup remains disabled by default for existing installations.
- EnerPrice remains advisory and does not automatically switch boilers, EV chargers, batteries or other devices.
- V2.5 supports one flexible load in Smart Setup; device-specific optimization and multi-load orchestration remain outside this release.
- Existing EnerPrice entities, services, integration domain and v2.4.x Smart Energy Advisor calls remain compatible.


## 2.4.1 - 2026-10-01

### Improved
- Register EnerPrice services once at integration-level setup instead of tying service availability to a loaded config entry.
- Add optional `flexible_load_power_w` to Smart Energy Advisor so measured surplus can be compared with the actual flexible-load demand.
- Distinguish full and partial surplus, expose surplus coverage, and include the remaining grid share in effective electric heat cost comparisons.
- Add English and Dutch copy-ready dashboard/setup recipes as groundwork for a future guided onboarding wizard.

### Compatibility
- Existing Smart Energy Advisor calls without `flexible_load_power_w` keep the v2.4.0 surplus-threshold behavior.
- EnerPrice remains advisory and does not directly switch user devices.
- Existing service names and response fields remain available.

## 2.4.0 - 2026-09-30

### Added
- Generic Smart Energy Advisor response service combining EnerPrice all-in electricity prices with optional Home Assistant gas-price, solar-production and grid-power entities.
- Useful-heat cost comparison between grid-electric and gas heating, with configurable electric efficiency, gas efficiency and gas energy content.
- Solar-surplus priority based on measured grid export when available, separate solar-production context, and forward-looking `wait` advice when a materially cheaper electricity interval is approaching.
- Direct numeric service inputs for testing and advanced automations without vendor-specific dependencies.\n- Optional `config_entry_id` selection for Smart Energy Advisor use with multiple EnerPrice configurations.\n- English and Dutch version-independent README header artwork.
- Expanded Dutch README (`README.nl.md`) with an English/Nederlands language switch and documentation for planners, services, runtime settings, chart attributes and migration.

### Safety and compatibility
- EnerPrice remains advisory and does not directly switch boilers or other loads.
- Existing entities, services, tariff calculations and the `nl_day_ahead_prices` domain remain unchanged.
- Smart Energy Advisor inputs are optional; existing installations require no new configuration.\n- Added edge-case coverage for measured solar surplus, equal heat costs, zero gas price and the exact future-price threshold.


All notable changes to **EnerPrice** are documented here.

## 2.3.0

### Added

- Extended the Price Advisor with future price context, including the next materially cheaper interval, time until that interval, the next better price, percentage savings for positive prices, and the best upcoming price.
- Added concise Dutch and English Advisor summaries for dashboards and practical flexible-load decisions.
- Added CasaRegie-inspired compact, full, and energy-advisor dashboard layouts using native Home Assistant Sections, headings, tiles, and Markdown, with ApexCharts in the richer layouts.
- Generated dashboards now resolve the actual EnerPrice entity IDs from the Home Assistant Entity Registry, so renamed or prefixed entities can be used automatically.

### Improved

- Made Advisor timing resolution-aware for hourly and quarter-hour prices and safe for negative prices.
- Made generated Advisor Markdown resilient when entities are temporarily unknown or unavailable.
- Added regression coverage for future-price advice, negative prices, quarter-hour wait times, compact/full dashboard output, and renamed Home Assistant entities.

### Compatibility

- Existing entity IDs, unique IDs, services, price calculations, supplier tariffs, and public price-array schemas remain compatible.
- The integration domain remains `nl_day_ahead_prices`.
- EnerPrice continues to provide advice and generated YAML; it does not directly switch user devices.

## 2.2.3

### Improved

- Reused shared all-in price data across sensor state and attribute updates to reduce repeated supplier-price calculations.
- Cached trend, rating, volatility and best/peak-period analysis within a coordinator cycle when inputs are identical.
- Avoided unnecessary trend calculations for price-rating sensors.
